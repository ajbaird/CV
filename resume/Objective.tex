\begin{cvparagraph}
\par
{I am driven by innovations in computational biology that span multiple spatial scales, from cellular function to whole-body physiological responses. I am inspired by research that will have an impact on quality of healthcare and believe that these solutions must bridge multiple disciplines in order to optimize patient outcomes. I am looking for a role that will empower me to pursue my research, teach the next generation of computational biologists, and foster, grow and lead a team. }
